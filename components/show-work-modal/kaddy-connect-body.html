            Kaddy is a B2B platform that allows wine retailers to access inventory held
            on consignment from thousands of suppliers and drop-ship their orders
            directly to their consumers from a network of strategically placed depots.
            It is Australiaâ€™s leading wholesale beverage marketplace. Supported by an
            end-to-end national fulfilment solution.

            My primary work with Kaddy were daily support and maintenance that includes
            development, design, and QA, working along with other team members.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have also been assigned to maintain a microservice that is built using
            Lumen framework. The functionality was to update order consignments from
            partner couriers within Australia such as Australia Post,
            CouriersPlease, Border Express, and company owned Kaddy Fulfilment.

                I was assigned to automate the order upload - a supplier integration.
                <br>
                <br>
                Suppliers will just send an
                email to one of our programmed email, and any attachments within that email
                that's in CSV format will be processed
                as orders automatically.
            </div>
            <div class="mt-5 text-md font-semibold">
                The process involves:
            </div>
            <div class="mt-2">
                1. First, Kaddy Admin will map the supplier's CSV sample order
                format.
            </div>
            <div class="mt-2">
                2. Second, Kaddy Admin will then set a source email. This is where the
                supplier can
                send email into.
            </div>
            <div class="mt-2">
                3. Then Kaddy Admin will set the integration as confirmed. After this,
                supplier for that integration can now start sending email.
            </div>
            <div class="mt-2">
                4. The recipient email that the supplier can send into needs to be a
                verified email in <span class="font-semibold">AWS SES</span>.
            </div>
            <div class="mt-2">
                5. Once a supplier starts sending email, <span class="font-semibold">AWS
                    SES</span> will be notified and
                trigger a <span class="font-semibold">Lambda</span> function to process the
                attachments and will be sent to <span class="font-semibold">AWS S3</span>.
            </div>
            <div class="mt-2">
                6. A command console that is set on <span class="font-semibold">cron</span>
                will process the attachments from <span class="font-semibold">AWS S3</span>
                into orders.
